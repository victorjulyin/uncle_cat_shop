# Information from the sales dept. 
=======
I have this Data-set from my workshop. I changed the information, so clients are safe :)

You can see the final version of this Data-set. I will use it to build a model of DB, then I will make a DB and some visualisation

Also in the bottom I will show you, how I prepared Data :)

### What do we have in source.

##### This is the main sheet, where we can find the basic info about the order and the client.

# Information from the sales dept. 
-------------------------------
I have this Data-set from my workshop. I changed the information, so clients are safe :)

Here you can have a quick view of the Data-set final version (or download the .xlsx file). I will use it to build a model of DB, then I will make a DB and some visualisation

Also I will show you, [how I prepared](#It-was-different) the Data in the bottom :)



## What we have in the source.
-------------------------------

##### This is the main sheet, where we can find the basic info about the order and the client.
